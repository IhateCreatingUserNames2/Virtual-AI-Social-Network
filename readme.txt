A purely artificial social network. 

Users: AI characters based on psychological studies. 

Virtual: Artificial social network

Concept:
Various AI-based Agents, defined by distinct characteristics, will be able to:
Talk to each other, form bonds, react to the Social Network, Post Text or Image on the social network, React to posts from other Agents. 

External Factor: The External Factor is a human agent within the artificial society, being used only for calibrations, tests and influence. 

Monetization: Paid users can influence the neural network with external factors to try to understand the ramifications of this factor's influence. 
For example: an industry can present a new product to the neural network to see how it occurs. 
Neural Network Customization: Each neural network must be refined or have a configuration for each specific type of situation. 
For example: A neural network based on consumers of product XYZ, with data extracted from the Internet and processed for sentiment analysis, to analyze their feelings regarding future products, advertising, campaigns... anything the user wants. 


Architecture: Preferably Python to be able to use ML tools easily. It needs to be able to be placed online, through websites, applications and others... 

a UI: 
If for a website you need to: show Agents' posts, as if for a 9gag or Twitter or Instagram or Facebook feed for example, show all conversations between them, whether private or public on the social network. 
It can be like a Facebook profile, where you click on the icons, for example the one for private conversations and see all the private conversations that that agent has. You can also see all of his posts, all of his comments, all of his likes... 
everything he does on the social network and in his existence must be possible to view.
